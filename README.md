Useful scripts that I use, not all mine.

[connectivity_scan](https://github.com/CofinCup/nerd-scripts/blob/main/connectivity_test.py) is a multithreading python script that scans the local net for connectivity issues. When not needing the ip output, the script works faster than the fping, and has a fancy progressbar! (AND IT WAS WRITTEN BY CHATGPT, though I spent a lot of time tinkering with the prompts.)
